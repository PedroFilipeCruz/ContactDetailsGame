Trade Log — Code Puzzle (Reorder Rows to 'HIREME')
=========================================================

How it works
------------
- Drag and drop the table rows using the handle (⋮⋮).
- The first letter of each row's **Note** (top to bottom) forms the current code.
- The tiles and similarity meter update live as you reorder.
- When the code equals **HIREME**, a success card opens with contact details.
